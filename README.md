If you want to change the player count you need to go in client/main.lua. On the bottom(55 line) you will find "maxPlayer = 128" change it to whatever you want.

If you want to change the color of the scoreboard you need to go in the app.js file and change the color on line 26. You need only to change the gray color to something else like green or blue. You can't change it to a hex or rgb color. Here is an image of what you need to look for.
